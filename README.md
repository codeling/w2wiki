# W2 wiki

W2 wiki is a web-based, wiki-like notepad that you can host yourself.


## Features:

- Elegant text markup:
    - Uses [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/codeling/w2wiki/blob/master/pages/MarkdownSyntax.md).
    - It supports double-brackets [[like this]] to link to another page in the wiki by title
    - It supports double-braces {{like this}} to link to an uploaded image
- Title & content search
- Filesystem storage (no database required) in plain Markdown text files.
- Image uploading support
- Optionally password-protected
- Unlike cloud / hosted solutions, you retain control of your data
- Written in PHP for portability and hackability
- Extremely compact (only a few .php files and a .css file)
- Differences to [original w2wiki by panicsteve](https://github.com/panicsteve/w2wiki):
    - Rudimentary, optional git integration to commit (and push) each page edit
    - Support for renaming and deleting pages
    - Markdown formatting syntax help on edit page
    - Localization support (en/de/ja/oc translations included)
    - Improved icon-based interface
    - Optional, always visible sidebar fed by a special page
	- Merged All/Recent list of all pages
    - Links:
        - Possibility to display pages that link to the current page
        - Support for links to sub-captions (using # in links)
	    - When navigating to a non-existing page, show links to similar pages
	    - Mark links to non-existing pages (by default in red)
        - Mark external links with globe icon
	- Image uploads:
		- Option to shrink uploaded images (based on maximum side length)
		- Fix rotation (based on EXIF data)
		- List of uploaded images providing usage information and option to delete

## TODO

- Improve upload folder location/configuration
    - Currently half hard-coded as "images" subfolder of root
    - current setup has strange dependency for uploads folder to be called "images" and to be a direct subfolder of where index.php is (due to serving files from there statically)
    - but path also should be within PAGES\_PATH (both pagse and uploads should be in same folder to capture both in git repository...)
	- so current setup requires an "images" soft link in root folder linking to actual images folder within PAGES\_PATH to be fully functional
